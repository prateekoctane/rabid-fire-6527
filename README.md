#  Welcome To Gun-Wars
<h1>hackathon project</h1>
<h2>This is a game that we made during the Hackathon using the html, css-animation, javscript and typescript.</h2>

<h1>Description</h3>
<p>The basic idea was that 2 squares opposite to each other will try to shoot at each other. The one who manages to shoot the other first wins the game. This idea looked very simple of paper but proved to be very challenging when we started. Firstly we broke down the problem statement in to 4 parts: the UI, the square's movements, hitting of bullet detection and multiplayer functionality.

The tech stacks used in this were React, javacript and typescript. 

Flow of the project:

On page load the start menu appears which has the details of the keys assigned to left and right player. there is also a start game button. when we click on the start game button it re-directs us to main game page where we can play. 

we have replaced the squares with guns because it looks much better. the up and down movemnt of the guns is acheived by "on key down" event. the bullet collision is detected by getboundingclientrect() funciton.
